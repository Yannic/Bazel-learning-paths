# Bazel-learning-paths
This repo has materials for learning Bazel: codelabs, presentations, examples.
We are open sourcing the content for training engineers in using Bazel and becoming contributors, so that we can growth this community.
This effort is an initial collaboration between:
- Automated Ascent https://automatedascent.com/ created by Benjamin Muschko, author of "Getting Started with Bazel" book
- EngFlow https://www.engflow.com, a Bazel tools company created by Ulf Adams, who led the development and open-sourcing of Bazel, and Helen Altshuler who led the developer adoption
We'd love the community feedback and participation!

Try it. File issues. Send us PRs. Contact to be more actively engaged as a collaborator!
