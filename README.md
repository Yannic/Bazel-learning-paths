# Bazel-learning-paths
This repo has materials for learning Bazel: codelabs, presentations, examples.
We are open sourcing the content for training engineers in using Bazel and becoming contributors, so that we can growth this community.
This effort is an initial collaboration between:
- Automated Ascent https://automatedascent.com/ created by Benjamin Muschko, author of "Getting Started with Bazel" book
- EngFlow https://www.engflow.com, a Bazel tools company created by Ulf Adams, who led the development and open-sourcing of Bazel, and Helen Altshuler who led the developer adoption
We'd love the community feedback and participation!

This project is currently under development, so check back within a month.
Try it. File issues. Send us PRs. Contact helen@engflow.com to be more actively engaged as a collaborator!
